Player places RRM
RRM is added to lowest numbered least full bucket
    Where are the buckets?
        One per device rate? Or is there a more elegant way?

All RRMs in a single bucket get run on that bucket's tick
If a bucket is empty on its tick then no RRMs run that tick


RRM.Buckets = {30 x {}}

processRRMS(global.Buckets.RRM[(tick % 30) + 1])



\scripts\bucket.lua
bucket.initSet(name, interval) -- Creates global.Buckets.name[] with interval empty tables
bucket.add(entity) -- This function will choose buckets based on machine class
bucket.remove(bucketSetEntry)

\scripts\machine.lua
machine.tick(entity) -- If entity is gone will bucket.remove(entity), bucket aware.
machine.range(entity) -- Support function for some machines (like RRMs)

\scripts\helper.lua
helper.offsetDirection(location, direction, offset)
helper.offsetArea(location, direction, offset, radius)

Track emptiest bucket per interval? Or determine emptiest bucket during add?
    Search on the fly to begin with.
